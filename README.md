# Windows Proxy Client in Python

This is a simple Windows Proxy Client written in Python. It allows you to set up a system proxy with a specified IP address and port, and it provides a convenient way to close the connection using the "Escape" key.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your Windows machine.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `windows_proxy_client.py` script is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python windows_proxy_client.py
   ```

4. The script will prompt you to enter the proxy IP address and port.

5. Once you enter the IP address and port, the script will enable the system proxy with the provided settings.

6. To close the proxy connection, simply press the "Escape" key.

7. The script will keep running until you close the terminal or press the "Escape" key to disable the system proxy and exit the program.

## Important Note
- This script modifies the Windows Registry to enable and disable the system proxy. Be cautious while using it and ensure you have the necessary permissions to make such changes.
